This project aimed to implement lofi audio generation with diffusion

## This project is currently on hiatus
It turns out, training something like this takes a massive amount of compute. It would take too long on local hardware, and the cost estimate for running this on cloud is not feasible for us. Luckily, Stability AI recently released [stable audio](https://stability.ai/stable-audio), with an extremely similar architecture, enabling us to see what this might have looked like given much more time and money.
